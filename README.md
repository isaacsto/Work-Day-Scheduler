# Work-Day-Scheduler

The purpose of this assignment was to take the starter code and improve the functionality of a workday scheduler. We had to use JavaScript to get the current day and display it, manipulate html classes to indicate past, present, and future in the page's display, and use localStorage to save and display user input.
